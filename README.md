## Configuration

I developed this mod with simplicity in mind, I decided to store home data inside the configuration file instead of NBT in Entity or World, this allows server owners fast migration between maps without loosing data and editing them which saves a lot of time.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Starting from version 2.0.0 the configuration file are now split into two different ones.

### homabric.config.conf

This file stores Homabric settings.

```shell
# Do not touch this value, it allows mod to
# check if config file is outdated or not.
configVersion=3
# This option enables alternative command variants like /sethome, /removehome and etc.
enableClassicCommands=true
# Sets the maximum amount of homes per player.
homesLimit=21
# You can define permissions that will override home limit for the players if they have them.
# Permission names are transformed to permissions like 'homabric.homelimit.<permissionName>'
# Example permission: vip: { max-homes=6 }
permissionsHomeLimit {}
# Sets the timeout in seconds before player will be teleported home.
# You can disable this feature by setting it to 0.
teleportCooldown=5
```

### homabric.homes.conf

This file contains all homes that are created by players.

```shell
players {
        # Player nickname (not a DisplayName)
        ExamplePlayer {
            # List of player homes
            homes {
                # Name of the home
                "village" {
                    # Players that can access this home
                    allowed-players=[]
                    # Icon must be an identifier, for example 'minecraft:cobblestone'
                    icon="minecraft:map"
                    # World where home is located
                    world="minecraft:overworld"
                    # Coordinates, including head position
                    pitch=7.15
                    x=160.66
                    y=72.0
                    yaw=-51.45
                    z=-76.45
                }
                # Example of home with allowed player 'Rogi27'
                home {
                    allowed-players=[
                        Rogi27
                    ]
                    icon="minecraft:iron_shovel"
                    pitch=8.25
                    world="minecraft:overworld"
                    x=1337.3
                    y=172.0
                    yaw=123.1
                    z=276.45
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

### Migration from 1.x.x

Due to breaking changes in 2.0.0 you are required to manually edit your config file and move `players` section from original config to new one called `homabric.homes.conf`.

## Planned features

- [x] Home limit can be set via permissions.
- [ ] Ability to define `/home` command aliases in config.
- [ ] Code quality improvements.
