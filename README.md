## Configuration
I developed this mod with simplicity in mind, I decided to store playerdata inside configuration file instead of NBT in Entity, this allows server owners fast migration between maps and provides them all information about players.

```shell
config {
    # Do not touch this value, it allows mod to 
    # check if config file is outdated or not
    configVersion=1
    # This option enables alternative command variants like /sethome, /removehome and etc.
    enableOldschoolCommands=true
    # Sets the maximum amount of homes per player
    maxHomes=2
    # List of players with their homes
    players {
        # Player nickname (not a DisplayName)
        ExamplePlayer {
            # List of player homes
            homes {
                # Name of the home
                "berries" {
                    # Players that can access this home
                    allowed-players=[]
                    # Icon must be an identifier, for example 'minecraft:cobblestone'
                    icon="minecraft:map"
                    # World where home is located
                    world="minecraft:overworld"
                    # Coordinates, including head position
                    x=160.66
                    y=72.0
                    yaw=-51.45
                    z=-76.45
                }
                # Example of home with allowed player 'Rogi27'
                home {
                    allowed-players=[
                        Rogi27
                    ]
                    icon="minecraft:map"
                    pitch=8.25
                    world="minecraft:overworld"
                    x=1337.3
                    y=172.0
                    yaw=123.1
                    z=276.45
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
